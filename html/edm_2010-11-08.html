    <p class="motion">That this House is concerned that the implications of the decision by the Court of <br />Appeal on 8 October 2010 will be that many victims of asbestos-related disease will die <br />without the certainty that their families will be entitled to compensation; agrees that it is <br />the exposure to asbestos that can lead to the development of fatal diseases such as <br />mesothelioma and that the trigger must therefore be the point of exposure and not, as <br />challenged by the insurance industry, the point the disease develops, which can be many <br />decades later; further agrees with the High Court ruling in 2008 that the insurers who <br />should pay compensation are those who provided cover to the employer at the time of the <br />asbestos exposure; notes this is the latest of many attacks by the insurance industry on <br />compensation for working people who were negligently exposed to deadly asbestos; and <br />calls on the Association of British Insurers to take action against any of its members who <br />are challenging the established trigger that is the point of exposure and support the <br />establishment of an Employers' Liability Insurance Bureau.</p>
